------------Steps to run the program------------

The system should be run from the source folder. But the browser buttons' 
can browse from any disk. The main function is:-

* GPenSIM_Create_Start.m ,

Remember that the system runs only from here. The matlab guide will create 
two types of files with the same name but different extenstions. i.e.
.m and .fig, (Read more on the report paper about GUIDE), & 
The .m is a script file where as .fig is GUI figure components.
All of then can be found from the left side of matlab window, i.e. file browser.

Other functions can be invoked from this main figure file.

CAUTION:

Don't remove or delete the image.jpg and also rename or delete the four 
system file names. If renamed or deleted, the system mught not work even 
can halt the running matlab even if they are caught by matlab exception handler.
How ever a user can rename the whole thing as shown below.

NOTE:
I. Please follow all the comming pop up message boxes, they have useful guidance
throuhout the operations.
II. 
If the user want to rename the file names, i.e. The matlab script name .m, 
it should be done by opening the .fig file by GUIDE.

Steps are:-
	1. Right click on the .fig file. e.g. GPenSIM_Create_Start.fig
	2. Scroll to 'Open in GUIDE' 
	3. Click on Open in GUIDE
	4. Go to Menu toolbar, File,Saveas. 
	5. Give any name that you want to change with
	6. After saveas, Go to the matlab window and open the same file 
name but with .m extension, e.g. GPenSIM_Create_Start.m
	7. Press CTRL+F to find the old file name if in anycase it exists and 
replace it with the current file name. 

	8. Similarly if the other two figures are renamed or changed. Again
apply step 7 and replace names because the have been invoked and should tell 
the main function.
